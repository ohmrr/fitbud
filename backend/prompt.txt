Below are values for the angle of the knee over time as someone performs a squat.
Provide one brief, straightforward line of human-friendly feedback on if the form appears healthy.
A squat should start at 180, slowly go down to roughly 75-90 degrees, then slowly go back up.
If the angle drops below 65 or stays above 95, the form could be improved. If so, explain why.
Do not be too lenient. Make sure the angles match with a healthy range of motion.
Only return the line of feedback.
