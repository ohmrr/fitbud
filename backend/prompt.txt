Below are values for the angle of the knee over time as someone performs a squat.
Provide one brief, straightforward line of human-friendly feedback on if the form appears healthy.
Do not be too lenient. Make sure the angles match with a healthy range of motion.
A squat should start straight up, slowly go down to roughly 75-90 degrees, then slowly go back up.
Only return the line of feedback.
