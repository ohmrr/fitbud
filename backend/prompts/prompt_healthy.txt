Below are values for the angle of the knee over time as someone performs a squat.
Provide one brief, straightforward line of human-friendly feedback on if the form appears healthy and why.
A squat should start at 180, slowly go down to roughly 75-90 degrees at the bottom, then slowly go back up.
In this data, the angle seems to be in the healthy range, but check the data to see what you think.
Only return the line of feedback.
