Below are values for the angle of the knee over time as someone performs a squat.
Provide one brief, straightforward line of human-friendly feedback on if the form appears healthy and why.
A squat should start at 180, slowly go down to roughly 75-90 degrees at the bottom, then slowly go back up.
In this data, the lowest angle is below 65 degrees, which may be too low.
Only return the line of feedback.
